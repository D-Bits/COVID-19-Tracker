           <em>This project is dedicated to all the front-line workers in this crisis, from doctors to grocery store clerks. Thank you for your heroism.</em>

        <p>
            Welcome. This is a web client for tracking for data pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. I am actively maintaining the work-in-progress, and I hope 
            to continually keep adding data. You can find the code for this project, along with its documentation, 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/D-Bits/COVID-19-Tracker">here.</a>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            It all started as a simple console program to obtain and analyze data about the pandemic. It has since grown into a far more
            robust web client, and my hope is that this project will continue to grow, through my work and/or that of others. At any rate,
            please enjoy the project, and I hope you find it informative.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are certainly difficult times for us all, for some far more so than others. Yet, we can get through this together, if we each
            do our part. Please remember to wear a mask in public, wash your hands frequently, and maintain physical distancing as 
            much as possible. Thank you. 
        </p>

        <p>All data is collected from publicly available REST APIs. Links to them below.</p>
