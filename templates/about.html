    <p class="about">
        This is a web client for tracking for data pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is currently very 
        much a work-in-progress, but there is still at least some data available. You can find the code for this 
        project, along with its documentation, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/D-Bits/COVID-19-Tracker">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p class="about">
        It all started as a simple console program to obtain and analyze data about the pandemic. It has since grown into a far more
        robust web client, and my hope is that this project will continue to grow, through my work and/or that of others. At any rate,
        please enjoy the project, and I hope you find it informative.
